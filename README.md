## Project Description
This project is the first project I created using jQuery. It displays a quote and it's author when the button is pressed. 

To see a demo: [Link](https://wman27.github.io/Random-Quote-Generator-Demo/)  

### Briefing
The requirements this project must satisfy are:

1. A quote-box that displays the quote and its author.
2. A clickable element that fetches and displays a new quote.

### Challenges
The main challenge of this project was:

- Where to store the quotes and to fetch it.

To solve this challenge I wanted to store the quotes in a json file to keep things tidy and consistent. So I decided to create a gist for the file containing the random quotes and authors which can then be fetched from there. This also helped to fix a CORS error that came with trying to fecth the data from local host.

The list of quotes can be found here: [Link](https://gist.github.com/wman27/8fd964ae63540a10f5cff06fbd6a735a)
